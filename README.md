# StudentDataSet
In This Dataset We are predicting various variable which are affecting students study   
By finding target varaibale & using testing & traing Data , we predict
Based on prediction result, failures, age, G1 ,G2& G3 are significant predictors for model.

Female students achieved a higher score than male students across all three grades.
